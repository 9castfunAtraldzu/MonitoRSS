It could contain malicious code that could harm your computer or steal your personal information. You could also expose yourself to cyberattacks by visiting shady websites or clicking on suspicious links.
- It is not reliable or effective. There is no guarantee that the keygen will work or that it will generate a valid key. It could fail to activate your software or cause errors and glitches. It could also be detected by Autodesk's anti-piracy measures and result in your software being disabled or blacklisted.

## What are the alternatives?
