# MonitoRSS

Note that this is the `dev` branch. This is a monorepo representing the partial re-write of the bot, MonitoRSS, to better handle the growing demands of the publicly hosted version in a distributed architecture. This work is still in-progress. For the stable version, please switch to the `master` branch.

More documentation is TBD, however some processes will be stored in the diagrams folder while they are being worked on as draw.io files.
