However, there are some websites that claim to offer a PDF download of the book. For example, Doku.pub[^1^] has a link to download a file named "Ebook Metoda Statistika Sudjana.pdf". However, this file is only 79.6 KB in size and contains only one page of the book's cover. It is not clear whether this file is authorized by the author or the publisher, or whether it is safe to download. Similarly, Scribd.com[^3^] [^4^] has some documents that contain the words "Statistika Sudjana" or "Metoda Statistika Sudjana" in their titles, but they are not the full PDF versions of the book either.
 
Therefore, if you want to read Sudjana's Metode Statistika, you may have to buy a physical copy of the book from a bookstore or borrow it from a library. Alternatively, you may contact the author or the publisher and ask them if they have a digital version of the book that you can purchase or access online. However, you should be careful not to download any files from untrusted sources that may contain viruses or malware.
  
Why is Sudjana's Metode Statistika a popular book among statistics students and researchers in Indonesia? One possible reason is that the book is written in Indonesian, which makes it easier for the readers to understand the concepts and examples. Another possible reason is that the book covers a wide range of statistical methods that are relevant and applicable to various disciplines, such as economics, education, psychology, agriculture, and engineering. The book also provides exercises and solutions at the end of each chapter, which help the readers to practice and check their understanding.
 
However, Sudjana's Metode Statistika is not the only book that teaches statistics in Indonesian. There are other books that have similar or different approaches to the subject. For example, Statistik untuk Ekonomi dan Niaga by Sudjana and Nana Supriatna is a book that focuses on the application of statistics to business and economics. Model-model Mengajar CBSA by Nana Sudjana and Wari Suwariyah is a book that introduces various teaching models based on competency-based curriculum. These books are also available at the National Library of Indonesia and other libraries.
 
Therefore, if you are interested in learning more about statistics or other related topics, you may want to explore other books besides Sudjana's Metode Statistika. You may also want to consult online resources, such as websites, blogs, videos, podcasts, or online courses that offer free or paid lessons on statistics. However, you should always verify the credibility and quality of the sources before using them. You should also seek feedback from your teachers, peers, or experts if you have any questions or doubts about your learning.
